Which operator is better? There is no clear answer. It all depends on your requirements and what channels you want to watch. The quality of your Internet and your location are also important here, since different services behave differently in different regions.",
    "operatorsIntro2": "The best option would be to try several services and determine the most suitable one for yourself. For this purpose, almost all operators provide a free test from one to several days for testing. Take advantage of this opportunity! Setup once - watch always!"
